This novel takes place over a long amount of time, but the part I am working on at the moment takes place in the late 1970&rsquo;s and throughout the 1980&rsquo;s. To not censor history, I have made my novel accurate to the time. It contains many swear words, ableist, and homophobic slurs as well as physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. Viewer discretion is advised. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.59y0g9xuxdv"><span class="c2">Prologue</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve been living with the Misteros, in upstate New York, for about two months. For the most part, I like it. They welcomed me into their whole family! It&rsquo;s crazy how big American families are. They have given me a long, white, robe that goes down to my feet, special arm bands, and a wrap for my ears. I miss my mama, but I&rsquo;m sure my friends will find her soon. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of the preacher&rsquo;s apprentices and I, Silkvre talk sometimes. She speaks to me in English all the time, and I have to tell her over and over I don&rsquo;t speak it yet! I sure hope I can learn English one day. I have to stick to Kezian for now. Silkvre watches horror movies with me. She likes them a whole lot. I can&rsquo;t even see them because they scare me... Silkvre says that it doesn&rsquo;t scare her at all! That&rsquo;s crazy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silkvre&rsquo;s mama is nice. She smokes cigarettes in the house though. That makes it hard for me to find my way around sometimes, since I&rsquo;m blind, and smell and hearing are my main navigation tools, the smoking puts me at a bit of a disadvantage. Silkvre&rsquo;s papa makes me a little nervous, but I understand it must be hard running a house. He calls me &ldquo;retard boy&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what Silkvre told me. I didn&rsquo;t know what a retard was. Silkvre told me it was someone who was really dumb. That kind of hurt my feelings. It is probably because I can&rsquo;t speak English. I guess that might be my fault, I mean I am living in their community, and I can&rsquo;t even speak one of their main languages! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve been going to Silkvre&rsquo;s brother, Gold, to teach me. He teaches me basic words, and reads me Kezian sacred texts, translated into English. He prays a whole lot- Americans take their religion &nbsp;very seriously. Every day they bring me to a building where Silkvre and her parents speak to the whole family about Keznivizdan. I was Kezian back in France, but it&rsquo;s crazy here! Gold tells me the people who practice casually like my mama will not go where we&rsquo;re going when we die. He says only the most devoted Kezians go to where good people go. His family saves people, so they can go there. That sounds very nice. I&rsquo;m glad for them. Maybe when we find my mama they can save her too. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gold is a nice boy. He always seems to be wearing his religious attire. He says he always needs to pray whenever he can, so Keznivizdan will save him. He wears a necklace, the dice hanging around his neck. My mom gave me a similar one back in France.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Another thing about Americans is that they don&rsquo;t seem to be afraid of anything. Silkvre had me go into her basement and hide in a cabinet, because she needed to speak to her parents alone, and it was family stuff that they didn&rsquo;t want me to hear since I was just a family friend. Silkvre came back later and she had a black eye! She had said she went out fighting the creatures of the forest without me after her parents talked to her about morning plans, and a bear got her right in the eye!! She said she killed it. I wish I was brave like her.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;For a girl, she really acts like a boy. I asked Gold why Sil acts like that when he is so quiet, and he said that is trying to be special, and that if she doesn&rsquo;t stop she won&rsquo;t go to where the good people go. I went to tell her about her brother&rsquo;s advice, and she cursed at me. It scared me, because kids aren&rsquo;t allowed to curse. She and her brother must have different ways of doing things, but I hear that&rsquo;s how siblings are.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
