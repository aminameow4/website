	Don’t Get Lost In The Woods is the story of Silkvre and Different, written and drawn by<a href="../Main/Creator-Info.html#gianna"><font face="Arial" size="6"> Gianna</font> </a>. They’re part of a species called Zelskiaine. All Zelski have been silent and hiding away from humankind out of fear in a religious cult-like group in Upstate New York. Silkvre is angry and wants to see the world like any human, she is a quick thinking loose cannon and seems to have no mercy in some situations. She is willing to do anything to get what she wants, even kill. She values strength over anything else. Different is a French immigrant, saved near death by Silkvre and her brother at a young age. He acts as her emotions of calmness, mercy, and morals. He is blinded from the attack he suffered and suffers with some similar issues to Silkvre. He is impressionable and wants to enjoy life around him. He has the same passion to set his species free, and sees Silkvre as a leader. The two learn more and more about each other as the story progresses. The story takes place from the late 1960’s into the late 2000’s, as the Zelski have a different lifespan to us. I’ve been working on this story since 2014 and I really hope you like it.
