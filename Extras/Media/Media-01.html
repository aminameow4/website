&nbsp;PETERS MINE, GUYANA-- It was very late at night when María Cortes was on her way driving home from Peters Mine. It was the same as any other night; quiet, with the only light being that of her car’s headlights and the stars. She recounts the moment when a “very tall person with scales” ran across the road. She claims to have almost hit the creature, but it seemed “to jump over my car as if it were going at a snail’s pace”. The creature allegedly ran back into the forest on the other side of the road. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;So what of this? It may have just been her overactive imagination, or some sort of survivalist, and she was in fact driving slowly. However this has not been the only sighting of its kind around Peters Mine. Many patrons recall seeing irregularly tall people stalking around in the shadows of the trees. Others claim that they’ve seen under the sleeves of people around the area, to see scales or bright green skin. Some people around the area have even snapped pictures of what appear to be eight-foot tall, gangly human-looking creatures. Many accounts speak of these creatures being a “cross between a lizard and human” and being “unsettlingly large.” Many cryptozoologists have categorized these creatures as members of the species known as “Reptilians”, a said to be descendants of the inhabitants from places such as the lost city of Atlantis, or even an alien species. Aliens or not, these creatures remain shrouded in mystery.
