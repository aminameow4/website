<article id="region">
<b>Native Region</b>: Europe
</article>
<br>
<article id="language">
<b>Language(s) Spoken</b>: Zelskiane, in addition to whatever the language of their region is.
</article>
<br>
<article id="attributes">
<b>Key Physical Attributes</b>: Cat ears and tail.
</article>
<br>
<article id="anatomy">	
<b>Anatomy</b>: Ability to hide Zelski ears and tail under certain skin. If they grow their fingernails out they grow into a thick hook, similar to a cat’s claw.
</article>
<br>
<article id="behaviors">
<b>Common Behaviors</b>: Infertility is a growing issue in their community. They travel alone if they are not in a religious cult.
</article>
<br>
<article id="eating">
<b>Eating Habits</b>: Zelskis are mainly Carnivorous, but do eat certain acidic fruits. The ones in my story force themselves to eat all kinds of foods, in attempt to assimilate to human culture. They don’t use silverware and eat on mats.
</article>
<br>
<article id="habitat">
<b>Preferred Habitat</b>: Generally forest areas. Though every Zelski is different.

</article>
<br>
<article id="family">
<b>Family Structure</b>: A Zelski’s baby stages are very very quick, which compels many of them to leave their mothers and fathers very early. However, if one chooses to stay, they will be further educated on religion, and will become a preacher at a young age.

<article id="stages">
<b>Life Stages</b>: 
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
<li>Baby:</li>

<li>Elder:</li>
</ul>
</article>
<article id="dress">
<b>Way of Dress</b>: In their religion, they do not wear revealing clothing (this goes for both sexes). They are encouraged to cover their Zelski ears to be modest. Zelskis are never to wear colored contacts or dye their hair. If a Zelski wants a piercing, they must get it from a preacher. All jewelry worn must be blessed by a preacher first. Many Zelskis can be seen wearing dice necklaces and various clothing containing a star with 6 sides, similar to an asterisk.

<br>	
<article id="religion">
<b>Religion?</b>: Yes! Kezism. Some worshipers are normal, though most are in a cult system that worship the god Keznivizdan, a young girl, given a dice cube by her father before his death, and by rolling it she is given the directions to the holy land, and chosen as a divine god, she is always depicted with her Zelski ears covered. Most Kezian rules are shown above in the way of dress section. The most important rule of Kezism is that you must not try to change your fate, you must stay quiet and let god guide you. A few of my characters are trapped in a Kezian cult. Rules are strict and must not be broken. If parents have more than one child, one of the children is chosen to be a preacher and taught religion from a young age. You must not speak the holy language (Zelski) around ANYONE but a Zelski Kezian.
