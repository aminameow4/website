<b>Birthday</b>: June 21, 2002
<br>
<b>Age</b>: 13
<br>
<b>About</b>: Bluzie's an outspoken edgy 13 year old. She has and unexplainable love for fire and all things warm, and enjoys hanging out with friends, drawing, and playing video games.

<b>Pronouns</b>: He/Him
<br>
<b>Birthday</b>: June 13, 2002
<br>
<b>Age</b>: 13
<br>
<b>About</b>: Random is a pretty quiet kid. He doesn't like to stand out much, and prefers to be left to his own devices. Leave him by himself with his laptop and he'll be perfectly fine. He tries to be kind and respectful of everyone around him and their boundaries, although he can at times become frustrated and more difficult to approach. He usually tags along with Bluzie on whatever her decided adventure of the day is, whether he was forced to by his parents, or of his own accord.

<b>Birthday</b>: November 16, 2002

<b>About</b>: Lily is indesputably the smartest of the friend group. Although she can be a bit shy around new people, she's a very loving and affectionate friend, and always tries to be around to lend a hand. Don't mistake her soft nature for weakness though, because she is prepared to stand up for herself and others if necessary. She loves flower crowns, reading, dancing, and all things considered 'cute'.
