&nbsp;Welcome! Felhzverse is a fictional universe full of unique species, cultures, with some stories, written by a group of bored kids who love fiction. We’ve tried to include a little bit of everything to make it as interactive as our current abilities will allow (this website itself has been the most difficult coding project any of us has taken on!). If you like comics, we have something for you. Written stories? Yeah, we have that too. Worldbuilding? We’re still adding more and more, but we have stuff for you too! This has sort of been a pet project of ours for a few years now, and we’re very proud to finally have it up on the internet, ready for judgement! If you’re new, just browse whatever pages we currently have available, to get a feel for the place. If you’re a returning viewer, you already know the deal, chill out and have fun. Or FAQ is below, but if you still have some unanswered questions, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:felhzversecomics@gmail.com"></a>felhzversecomics@gmail.com, or contact us through our official Discord! (You can find a link to that on our home page.)

<br>
<br>
<font size="5">
<font size="6"><i><u>When did Felhzverse start?</u></i></font>
<br>
We’ve been working on this project since at least mid-2016, although this site has only been online since April 29, 2018!
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>What does Felhzverse mean?</u></i></font>
<br>
FELHZ stands for the five original species we had in the lineup. <u>F</u>eratrans, <u>E</u>yote, <u>L</u>ilibethians, <u>H</u>umans, and <u>Z</u>elski. “Verse” is just our taking the second half of universe.
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>Who runs Felhzverse?</u></i></font>
<br>
Well, everyone in Staff does. We created one universe, and all have our own subdomains that we work on. (Ex: Amina, the person typing this, codes and maintains our website. Nick works on public relations and social media. Alice writes up magical rules.)
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>Can I make a Felhzverse OC?</u></i></font>
<br>
Yes! Please go the heck ahead! If you’re feeling so bold, please send Amina a picture! As long as you stick to the regulations of a species(physical traits, magic status, diet, etc.), go wild! We love seeing others interact with our content! 
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>How can I contribute to the universe?</u></i></font>
<br>
The easiest way is to make OCs! Write stories! But if that’s not your thing, you can ask questions and theorize about stuff then send it to us! If your idea doesn’t affect conflict with already established concepts in the universe, and all of Staff like it, we’ll add it in! In addition, we're hoping to be able to start up contests and such to affect some aspects of hte universe.
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>Can my character be in one of the stories on the site?</u></i></font>
<br>
Depends on the creator! Preferences vary from series to series-
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>For <u>Don’t Get Lost in the Woods</u>, Zelski OCs will not be put into canon content.</li>
<li>For <u>The Differences Between Us</u>, fan OCs will only show up as background characters, if Shiro decides he likes the design.</li>
<li>For <u>Zodiac Family</u>, once again, fan characters will only show up as background characters.</li>
<li>For <u>Life’s Expectations</u>, Fan OCs can show up as background or minor characters if the creator of the character so desires.</li>
<li>For <u>Don’t Take it Seriously</u>, Fan OCs can also show up as background or minor characters if the creator of the character so desires.</li>
</ul> 
<font size="6"><i><u>Can my story be part of the Felhzverse site?</u></i></font>
<br>
This is where we’re a bit “iffy.” The stories on site are something we’ve developed together as a group of friends over a couple years. We’ve gotten a feel for the characters and how they connect with one another, and although you’re probably a lovely person with a nice story, we cannot say the same about you. This could change in the future, but currently, no. 
<br>
<br>
<font size="6"><i><u>I see that some of the species speak languages that don’t exist in real life. Is there any guide to these languages?</u></i></font>
<br>
Due to our choosing to focus on visual aspects of the universe and worldbuilding, we don’t have a language guide on the site at this time. We’re hoping to be able to create a translator(like Google Translate, but hopefully of higher quality), or at least some sort of dictionary in the future though! For now, the most we can do is post some minor stuff in our articles in Media.
