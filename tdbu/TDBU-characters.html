<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="nathan">
<img src="../Icons/Nathan_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Nathan Landvik
<br>
Pronouns: He/him
<br>
Birthday: July 16, 1994
<br>
Age (In Story): 18
<br>
About: The Edgelord. A hipster who says things for the sake of bragging and making himself "cooler." He's hot headed and adventurous, getting into trouble the majority of his life. His careless actions often lead him into the danger he oh-so desires.
</font></div>
<!--Nadarie-->
<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="nadarie">
<img src="../Icons/Nadarie_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Nadarie Aquaeli-Rey Lerafîané
<br>
Pronouns: He/him
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): XXXX
<br>
About: Claims to be the "spawn of royalty" of another universe. It sounds ridiculous because he sounds and looks like a human. He appears to be overly amused and fascinated by everything humans do.
</font></div>
<!--Briet-->
<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="briet">
<img src="../Icons/Briet_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Briet Familiar
<br>
Pronouns: They/them
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): XXXX
<br>
About: Very attached to Nadarie. They idolize him and their appearance is even similar to his, despite them not even being related. They speak with a monotone voice and stoic face. Any emotion that comes from them is only directed towards Nadarie, whom they address as "Sir."
</font></div>
<!--Kinyea-->
<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="kinyea">
<img src="../Icons/Kinyea_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Kinyea Ilimux
<br>
Pronouns: He/him
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): 16(?)
<br>
About: He's a lanky teenage boy. Something about his appearance seems unhealthy, or unworldly. His skin is unnaturally dull and his teeth are sharp and pointed, the same with his nails. He's seems cowardice, and tails behind Nadarie, always refusing to speak unless spoken to. Despite this, it's not uncommon to see him scowl at random passerbys.
</font></div>
<!--Nikk-->
<!-- add later>
<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="nikk">
<img src="../Icons/Nikk_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Nikolas "Nikk" Landvik
<br>
Pronouns: They/them, He/him
<br>
Birthdate: July 16, 1994
<br>
Age(in story): 18
<br>
About: The opposite of his older triplet, Nikk is very calm, relaxed, and a very down to Earth person. He strives to be everything Nathan isn't, and that was the motivation for his success in school and any activities that would benefit him. Despite looking like a seemingly good person, Nikk is very selfish.
