<br>
Birthday: July 16, 1994
<br>
Age (In Story): 18

Nadarie Aquaeli-Rey Lerafîané
<br>
Pronouns: He/him
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): XXXX
<br>
About: Claims to be the "spawn of royalty" of another universe. It sounds ridiculous because he sounds and looks like a human. He appears to be overly amused and fascinated by everything humans do.

<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="briet">
<img src="../Icons/Briet_pfp.png" ><font face="Arial" size="5">
<br>
Briet Familiar
<br>
Pronouns: They/them
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): XXXX
<br>
About: Very attached to Nadarie. They idolize him and their appearance is even similar to his, despite them not even being related. They speak with a monotone voice and stoic face. Any emotion that comes from them is only directed towards Nadarie, whom they address as "Sir."

<div style="background-color:#E9FFD1" id="kinyea">

<br>
Kinyea Ilimux
<br>
Pronouns: He/him
<br>
Birthdate: XXXX
<br>
Age(in story): 16(?)
<br>
About: He's a lanky teenage boy. Something about his appearance seems unhealthy, or unworldly. His skin is unnaturally dull and his teeth are sharp and pointed, the same with his nails. He's seems cowardice, and tails behind Nadarie, always refusing to speak unless spoken to. Despite this, it's not uncommon to see him scowl at random passerbys.
